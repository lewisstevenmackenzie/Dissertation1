1,INF11116,Data-Driven Decision Making (Blended mode),20,11,n/a,0,0,100,"A primary use of data by contemporary organisations is to analyse and explore opportunities for growth or change, either directly or indirectly. The demand for business data, whether operational management, data analytics or data science (such as big data, machine learning & predictive analytics) has increased substantially. This has resulted from an organisational need for a more sophisticated approach to analytics and data from both a business and statistical understanding of data and its impacts on the organisation. This raises complex and multifaceted issues.

The aim of the module is to enable you develop a deep understanding of the business context and impact of data, the meaning of the data (including in terms of statistics), and to give you an opportunity to express this in the form of professional written reports. Topics covered include:
The role of the data scientist
Data strategy and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Deployment and implementation
Governance, ethical and cultural implications
Exploring and describing data,
Statistical inference  parametric methods t  tests and Analysis of Variance Statistical presentation of data.
Multivariate methods  principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis and segmentation methods (Hierarchical clustering, K means and K modes).
Statistical modelling  OLS regression, general linear models exemplified by Binary Logistic models
Diagnosing model fits

The R package for statistics will be used in this module.

1,CSN11125,Host-Based Forensics [ASDF],20,11,n/a,30,40,30,"This module will cover elements of operating system disk-level architectures, such as Windows and Linux. This will allow students to study how operating systems store system and user data, and thus students will gain an understanding as to what information could technically be held on such systems. This data could include user files, as well as user activities such as login session data, browsing histories, operating system manipulation, and general user interactions with a variety of operating system tools. This understanding will be expanded through theoretical knowledge and practical exercises in extracting information from systems, using a variety of open source and commercial forensic analysis tools, and documenting the results of such a process using consistent and thorough evidential procedures. This includes the production of event timelines, as well as the analysis of system logs, operating system state, file systems, and application data. The module will also consider the ethical and professional issues related to digital forensics.",{'Robert Ludwiniak'},"[{'name': 'Cyber Security'}, {'name': 'Systems Engineering'}]","[{'name': 'system'}, {'name': 'data'}, {'name': 'Security'}, {'name': 'Systems'}, {'name': 'analysis'}]"
